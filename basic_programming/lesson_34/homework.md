1. Create an anonymous class that implements `Comparator<String>`. Compare strings based on the number of vowel letters.
    - **Hint**: Use the `charAt()` method to iterate through each character in the string and count the vowels.

2. Using a lambda expression, implement a `Comparator<String>` that compares strings based on the number of consonant letters.
    - **Hint**: You can also use the `charAt()` method to count consonants.

3. **Predicates**: Create a predicate that checks whether an integer is a power of two.
    - **Hint**: A number is a power of two if `n & (n - 1) == 0` and `n > 0`.

4.

**Task**:  
You have a `Student` class with fields `name` (name), `age` (age), and `gpa` (grade point average). Your task is to write a program that can filter and sort a list of students based on various criteria.

**Subtasks**:

1. **Predicate**: Create a predicate that checks whether the student is of legal age (age 18 and above).
2. **Lambda Expression and Comparator**: Using a lambda expression, create a comparator that sorts the students based on their grade point average (GPA) in descending order.
3. **Final Task**: Create a method that takes an array of students and uses the predicate and comparator to:
    - Filter the list, leaving only students who are of legal age.
    - Sort the filtered list based on grade point average in descending order.
